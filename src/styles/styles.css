/**
 * NOTE:
 *
 * This font face declaration was extracted from the
 * GlobalStyles styled-components component because it
 * was causing rendering issues where the pages component
 * tree got re-rendered (due to state changes like
 * infoOpen and filterOpen).
 *
 * I'm guessing this is because everything the component
 * tree is re-rendered, this font-face declaration is
 * re-declared. For whatever reason, this was the cause
 * for the text to flash / change font when state was
 * in the main page component.
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 * Add woff2 and possibly ttf options for optimal browser
 * support.
